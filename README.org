* flash
Flash messages in the UI when something noteworthy happens. 

(My odd tribute to Rails [[http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionDispatch/Flash.html][terminology]].)

** Installation
Require in Leinigen or Boot:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
[org.danielsz/flash "0.1.1"]
#+END_SRC

Where the current version is:

[[https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/org.danielsz/flash.svg]]

Implicit dependencies are React or [[https://github.com/omcljs/om][Om]] and [[http://getbootstrap.com/][Bootstrap]]. Widgets are provided for both.

** Usage
Require the namespace: 

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(require '[flash.core :as f])
#+END_SRC

Make sure the app state has a key called flash, and create a ref-cursor.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(def app-state (atom {:flash {}
                      ...}))
(def flash #(om/ref-cursor (:flash (om/root-cursor state)))
#+END_SRC

Put the widget in your UI (where it makes most sense). Pass in a map with the flash cursor and a timeout value (measured in seconds).

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(om/build f/widget {:flash flash :timeout 3})
#+END_SRC

Now you can use any one of the following: 

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(f/warn flash “This is a message with warning level”)
(f/info flash “This is a message with info level”)
(f/alert flash “This is a message with danger level”)
(f/bless flash “This is a message with success level”)
#+END_SRC
